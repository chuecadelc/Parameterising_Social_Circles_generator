This repository contains the Social Circles model, originally created by Hamill and Gilbert (2009) in Netlogo (https://www.jasss.org/12/2/3.html). We reproduced and expanded the original set of experiments to include more social reaches and population composition scenarios as well as measured more structural network properties.
