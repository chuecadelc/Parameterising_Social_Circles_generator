This repository contains the code for our paper Chueca Del Cerro, C and Badham, J (2025) Tunable Network Properties with Hamill and Gilbert's Social Circles Generator, _Applied Network Science_. The Social Circles model was originally created by Hamill and Gilbert (2009) in Netlogo (https://www.jasss.org/12/2/3.html), re-implemented in Julia and expanded the original set of experiments to include more social reaches and population composition scenarios as well as measured more structural network properties.
